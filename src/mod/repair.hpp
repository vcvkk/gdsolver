// Stage C: the repair loop, inside the game.
//
// The loop is a loop around two things the mod already has: solving (dp/, linked in since
// Stage B) and replaying (a session). It began as a port of the Python driver and is now the
// only copy -- the state a re-anchor needs is read off PlayerObject while the replay runs,
// instead of being parsed back out of dump.csv afterwards.
//
//   solve the whole level  ->  replay it in GD  ->  it dies at tick dt
//                                                       |
//          splice the tail onto the verified prefix  <--+  re-anchor on GD's REAL state
//                                                          some ticks before the death and
//                                                          solve the tail from there
//
// The model is wrong somewhere -- that is the premise of the whole project. What makes the loop
// work is that GD is the authority on where it is wrong: the prefix that GD actually replayed
// is true by construction, so every iteration keeps it and only re-solves what comes after.
//
// This loop clears all 22 cold on its own (py/cold_regress.py, 2026-08-27), so the list that
// used to stand here -- fixups, capacity tiers, needtrig, phantom vetoes, dead bands, moving-
// geometry harvesting, sprite rotation -- is spent; all of it is below, and two rungs the driver
// never had are as well (the unseen-door retry and the forced mode-portal crossing).
//
// WHAT IS STILL ONLY IN THE DRIVER, and why none of it is load-bearing here:
//   * section rescue as an automatic rung. `secsolve` exists (src/solver/secsolve.hpp) and can be
//     started by hand from poll(), but it is a one-way handoff: it never splices its result back
//     and never resumes the loop. The driver escalates entry points and re-solves the previous
//     section on its own. No level in the suite has needed it in-process.
//   * reversible segment boundaries and prefix cutting on frontier width (the driver reads
//     --bands, which this loop does not even ask leveldp for).
//   * lookahead DOUBLING. This loop runs the inverse -- the whole level, shortened to
//     kHorizonShort under stall -- which covers the same ground from the other end.

//     there -- 4 uids at 3 anchors. The old note here said no such trigger existed in the
//     corpus.
//   - UNDER: the crossing test only ran between two rows in the SAME gframe, so the tick on
//     which a 2900 actually turned the frame was never looked at -- 91 uids at 36 anchors
//     (uid 4355 at t=4,646, uid 6286 at t=11,332).

//           (an id-2900 that is not channel-only) within 2 px; entries of other

//           channel's reverse bit from the switching 2900's gnddir.

//             C1  an entry passed over before a visible fire must have been seen
//                 to fire (a 2899: ctrlOff changing as the player crosses it)

//             A (1)  that entry fires visibly later in the same attempt
//             E (2)  A, or for a 2899: crossed at or before t0 while its channel

        // stop meaning what a census record means by it. The four inputs are

        // its definition: change cause_of and every stored string is stale,
        // while inputs can be re-signed. Same choice as uid over bit index.
        //
        // A TAIL, not fields in the middle: two readers key on adjacency
        // (archive_dy_census.py:22, fixup_bias_census.py:44) and an insertion
        // would drop their rows in silence. dp made the same choice for
        // `,dual2=` and gives the reason at cli.hpp:549.
        // ...and WHAT GD WAS RESTING ON, which is the half a family cannot see.
        //
        // A family is spelled from the MODEL's row: `clamp` and `clampuid` below
        // come from the model's own trace, and GD contributes only onGround and
        // mode. So a transition where GD was held against something and the
        // model thought it was in free air is spelled `/air` -- the family names
        // the model's story about the tick and has no room for the game's. That
        // makes "no clamp-bearing family in this run" ambiguous between "no such
        // divergence happened" and "the contact was on GD's side", which is the
        // half the family cannot express. Measured 2026-09-11: 8 of the run's 69
        // records carry a model-side clamp, and nothing in the log could say how
        // many carried a game-side one.
        //
        // NOT NAMED `gdclamp`. GD has no clamp: it has `m_objectSnappedTo` and
        // `m_snapDistance` (recorded raw at :183), which answer "the game placed
        // the player against object U, by D px". Calling that a clamp would put
        // the model's concept in the game's mouth and the name would then be
        // read as agreement between two things that were never compared.
        //
        // From gCur, not gPrev: the snap happens inside the step, the same
        // reason `clamp` below is read from the next row. -1 = no row (a kill)
        // or nothing snapped, and those two are already distinguished by gdgo.
        //
        // ★AND IT IS NOT A PER-TICK CONTACT PREDICATE. m_objectSnappedTo is
        // STICKY: it keeps the last object it snapped to, and GD does not clear
        // it on leaving. Measured on gdref/lv22.csv (21,140 ticks): snapuid >= 0
        // on 98% of all ticks and on ★99% of the AIRBORNE ones, with a single
        // value persisting up to 3,818 ticks. So `gdsnap >= 0` says "the game
        // has snapped to U at or before this tick", NOT "the game is holding
        // the player here", and a count of records with a non-negative gdsnap
        // is not a count of contacts. This was written down after taking that
        // count -- 60 of 69 records, which read as a discovery and is an
        // artefact of the field's persistence.
        //
        // What that leaves: the pair still says WHICH object and how far, which
        // no other field on this line carries, and it is exact when read at a
        // tick where the snap CHANGES. What it does not do is close the gap
        // this tail was added for. The recording's only per-tick contact facts
        // are onGround/onGround2, already here as gdg/gdgo, so "GD held the
        // player while the model flew" cannot be answered from what is recorded
        // today; answering it needs a new recorded field, not a new print.
        //
        // gdsnapd is not gated by gdsnap either: a record here carried
        // gdsnap=-1 with gdsnapd=27.79. The uid is the gate; the distance
        // beside a -1 is the previous snap's, left over.

// ---- checkpoint flights (cfg `dpcheck`, default off) ------------------------------------------
//
// THE PROBLEM. A whole-level search costs 45-60 s on lv22, and the game then kills the plan
// 100-1500 ticks past the anchor. On the 2026-09-17 blessed cold run, 33 of lv22's 44 rounds
// taught the model something (a new fixup record), and the 523 s of search before those rounds
// was spent almost entirely past the point where the game would have shown the model wrong.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES. While a search runs, the game flies the search's checkpoints (dp/progress.hpp):
// at fixed layers past the anchor, the lineage of the frontier's first state. A checkpoint that
// survives to its last tick is passed. One the game kills strictly inside is a disagreement with
// the model -- every frontier state is alive in the model through its layer -- so the search is
// cancelled, the fixup recorder runs on that flight, and the same question is solved again
// (ckLearn, runLadder). The loop's own rounds, verdicts and bookkeeping are untouched: they only
// ever see the search that ran to the end.
//
// WHY THE OUTCOME DOES NOT DEPEND ON TIMING. Checkpoints are layers, flights are judged in order,
// and dp holds its answer until every published checkpoint is judged -- so the sequence of flights,
// deaths and records is a function of the model and the game alone. The first version of this
// flew the frontier's common prefix and ended the round on a death; it was measured and not kept
// (lv22, 2026-09-17: the frontier stayed forked for thousands of ticks past the deaths, and a
// cancelled rung had no verdict for the ladder to book).
//
// A flight that dies AT or PAST its last tick, or on a tick this job has already learnt from, is
// passed: the first is the plan running out, the second would cancel again and again.

// End of a physics tick. A flight whose inputs have run out is held right there and passed:
// left to run on, it either dies a death that means nothing or wanders into the stall guard.
