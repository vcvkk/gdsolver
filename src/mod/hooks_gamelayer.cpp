// removeObjectFromSection calls -- on the two players, not in a loop.

// The layout, read off addToSection (0x226500) / removeObjectFromSection
// (0x226d60) / sortSectionVector itself:
//     +0x35b0  vector<vector<vector<GameObject*>*>*>   sections[i][j] -> leaf
//     +0x3658  vector<vector<int>*>                    counts  [i][j] = LIVE size
// and the same pair again at +0x35c8 / +0x3670 for the second family. A leaf is
// only ever push_back'd; removal swaps the last live element into the hole and
// decrements counts[i][j]. So the leaf's std::vector size is a HIGH-WATER MARK
// and counts[i][j] is the live number -- the sort's own bound
// (`movsxd rsi, [counts + j*4]`, then std::sort over rsi elements).
//
// That asymmetry is the whole point of measuring it. Add and remove are
// symmetric on every arm (both dispatch on obj+0x40c == 0x718, obj+0x3a0 == 7 and
// obj+0x280 the same way), so the maintenance CANNOT leak by itself: `live` can
// only grow if something adds objects to sections without removing them. If
// `live` is flat across a run, the restore ramp is not the section vectors and
// this closes brief-023 (A) as a negative; if it climbs, the ramp has its
