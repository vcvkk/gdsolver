// offset the earlier survey gave and the audit "corrected" away. The audit's
// own evidence for the correction was that 0xc38 never appears in the dumps,
// and it would not: the decompiler prints the scaled form.
//
// MEASURED, one run per offset, `oobtest=1` injecting a 1 at the checkpoint and
// the restore 1,080 ticks later reading what the game left:
//
//   byte 0x187   injected 1 -> still 1 at the restore. Nothing cleared it in
//                1,080 ticks, on a run where the player is never out of

//   byte 0xC38   injected 1 -> 0 at the restore. Cleared, which is exactly
